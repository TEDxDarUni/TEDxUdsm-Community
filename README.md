## About TED

> TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Starting as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan, and Daniel Kahneman.

## About TEDx

> In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks videos and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to given rules and regulations.

## Event Organizers

Lead organizer: **Alex Mkwizu** 

> I have always believed to be a problem solver from a young age. Whilst in my secondary studies. I fell in love with the art of oration and its power to move souls, channel energy, and bring forth the desired impact. Exploring the field, I learned there is a huge gap for African narratives that have the power to shape generations to generations. I believe #tedxudsm is a step towards shaping African narratives, especially from Tanzania. 

Co-Lead Organizer: **Msafiri Ulimali**

> Stories make a difference. I have always believed in the power of stories, that they can change lives and even what people think. #tedxudsm has been a platform for them to tell their stories, be it about their personal lives, their careers, business or other creative issues. #tedxudsm2021 is just the beginning of bringing these stories to the hearts of Tanzanians.
